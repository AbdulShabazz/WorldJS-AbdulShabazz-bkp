### About World.JS

World.JS is A JavaScript Wrapper for World Vocoder Powered by Emscripten.

You can use World Vocoder in your Browser,Node or Electron app and many more.

####  About Emscripten
Emscripten is a toolchain for compiling to asm.js and WebAssembly, built using LLVM, that lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins.
- Fast as near-native speed.
- Easy to use.
- Powerful

#### About World

Morise's World Vocoder is a fast and high-quality vocoder. World Vocoder parameterizes speech into three components:

1. Pitch (fundamental frequency, F0) contour
2. Harmonic spectral envelope
3. Aperiodic spectral envelope (relative to the harmonic spectral envelope)

For more information, please visit [Morise's World repository](https://github.com/mmorise/World) and the [official website of World Vocoder](http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~mmorise/world/english/)
