### API
```
World Native:
- [x] WavRead_JS             # .wav input functions.
- [x] DIO_JS                 # F0 estimation based on DIO (Distributed Inline-filter Operation).
- [x] Harvest_JS             # F0 estimation based on Harvest.
- [x] DisplayInformation     # Display Information.
- [x] DisplayInformationVal  # Display Information by Audio object from WavRead_JS()
- [X] GetInformation         # Output information in HTML.
- [x] CheapTrick_JS          # Spectral envelope estimation on the basis of the idea of CheapTrick.
- [x] D4C_JS                 # Band-aperiodicity estimation on the basis of the idea of D4C.
- [X] Synthesis_JS           # Voice synthesis based on f0, spectrogram and aperiodicity.
- [x] WavWrite_JS            # Output Wav File.

Wrapper:
- [x] Wav2World              # Wav to world.
- [ ] WavInJS                # Load wav file as WavRead do in JavaScript.
```
